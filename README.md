DESCRIPTION

Welcome to the demo version of the league of heroes game!

The main hero returns from a long journey and learns that monsters have been
raiding a small village near his possessions for many years. They rob and terrorize
the people of this little village. It's time to put an end to this! Fearless main
hero must go straight into the lair of monsters and fight back!

RULES

To begin with, you will be asked to create the main hero and monsters, giving
them attack and defense indicators, as well as giving them names. You can create 
more than one monster, but there must be only one main hero.

After that you will be able to proceed to the main action of the game - to attack.
Not only the main character can attack, but also monsters. The main hero has 
the ability to use a first aid kit to regenerate 50% of their maximum health. A 
total of 3 first aid kits are given. During the attack, the any character can both 
miss or inflict a critical hit - his most powerful. 

The game will end if the main hero is defeated or all the monsters are defeated.

Have fun!
